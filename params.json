{"name":"Luxe","tagline":"A Tumblr theme inspired by Hollywood glamour","body":"Luxe\r\n====\r\n\r\nLos Angeles Luxe, or Luxe for short, is a Tumblr theme inspired by Hollywood glamour. A working example of the theme\r\ncan be found here: http://los-angeles-luxe.tumblr.com.\r\n\r\nNotes on customizing the theme:\r\n\r\nBackground image: Use subtle_dots.png (included file) as the background image.\r\n\r\nAvatar: For the best effect, I would recommend using a rounded avatar image on a transparent background. \r\nRoundedavatar.png has been included as a sample avatar. \r\n\r\nAlso, if you are new to customizing Twitter themes, I would recommend that you make a backup of your existing Tumblr theme,\r\nbefore attempting to use this one.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
