Luxe
====

Los Angeles Luxe, or Luxe for short, is a Tumblr theme inspired by Hollywood glamour. A working example of the theme
can be found here: http://los-angeles-luxe.tumblr.com.

Notes on customizing the theme:

Background image: Use subtle_dots.png (included file) as the background image.

Avatar: For the best effect, I would recommend using a rounded avatar image on a transparent background. 
Roundedavatar.png has been included as a sample avatar. 

Also, if you are new to customizing Twitter themes, I would recommend that you make a backup of your existing Tumblr theme,
before attempting to use this one.

Enjoy!
